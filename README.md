# mp3rename
A small Python3 code I wrote to rename my mp3 files based on their mp3 tags. Windows only.
You'll need to install a python module called mp3_tagger for this. The installation steps are:
1) Open commdand prompt as adminstator
2) Type "pip install mp3_tagger"

After this, feel free to run the code.

Note: All your mp3 files should be stored in D:\Music.
